On the first day of 2021 it decided to try again on making everydays. I tried several times in the past already, but all my attempts died silently 
To persevere this time, I published my dailies on Twitter. For a time I also posted them on Instagram. But after the summer I stopped posting them on Instagram.

What did it teach me? I actually didn't that much. I managed to understand the lerp function a bit. Also creating objects was something I learned a bit. However I also learned my mathematical skills are dusty. I just use the basics and find myself constrained my own limitations. Or I just have to accept I shouldn't aim that high. Maybe this will feed the growing imposter syndrome I will eventually end up with.

The dailies did give me insight into NFT's and the process of minting an artwork on the blockchain. Apparently NFT'S were a big thing in 2021 and will continue to be in 2022.

So where will all this leave me at the start of 2022?
